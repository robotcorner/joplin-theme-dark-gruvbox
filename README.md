# JOPLIN THEME - DARK GRUVBOX

### About

Inspired by "Mayukai Mirage Gruvbox Darktooth Theme" on VSCode.

This theme used the [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) pallete of colors mainly. I heavily modified the colors from https://github.com/amandamcg/joplin-theme and added a view touches like better quote blocks.

### Support

In order to change settings you need to open your joplin advanced theme settings.

- Userchrome.css (Modifies entire app view, except markdown)
- Userstyle.css (Modifies just the markdown previewer)

*Important:* Make sure you either download the fonts listed in the style and userchrome sheet or change them to something available on your system. I tested these a lot though, and they seem to work really well with each other. You can get the ones I selected from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
